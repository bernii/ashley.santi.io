    <h1>Traveling around Argentina</h1>

    <p>Since you're coming all this way to party with us, we hope you'll consider taking some time to explore Argentina (or its surrounding countries) before or after the wedding! From gigantic waterwalls in Iguazu, to drinking delicious Malbec wines in Mendoza, to standing in the southernmost city in the world, Ushuaia, there are countless awesome things to see and do in South America.</p> 

      <p>We asked our travel agent to put together some sample iteneraries to give you an idea of trips to take. Please keep in mind these prices are guestimates based on 4 star hotels (3 star equivalent in the US) - you can easily go way less expensive (or more) if you'd like! </p>
